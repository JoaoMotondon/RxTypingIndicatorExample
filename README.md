# RxTypingIndicatorExample
The goal of this project it to demonstrate how to implement a "typing indicator message" by using reactive programming in an Android app. We will run into some different approaches using different operators combinations. The first two, window and buffer will not fit our requirements and we will go through them to show why they did not work for us. Then we will present a third option by using a combination of publish–ambWith–timer operators that will work exactly as we expect. 


Please, refer to [this article](http://androidahead.com/2017/04/03/typing-indicator-using-rxjava/) for detailed information.
